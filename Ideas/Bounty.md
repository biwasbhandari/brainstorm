So what we planned is to post bounties instead of hiring people. 
## How would we do it
- Add bounty as issue in github repo
- Instead of directly providing link to issue what we will do is create a bounty in website
- Add its status and also announce winners
## Benefits
- Auto promotion of Company
- Increases engagement in website as well as community
