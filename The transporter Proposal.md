In today's digital world, sharing files safely and easily is very important. Many current methods don't protect our data well, making it easy for unauthorized people to access sensitive information. To address this, we are developing "The Transporter," a secure file-sharing application. The Transporter will automatically encrypt files when users upload them, ensuring data remains private. Users can share these encrypted files through unique links, allowing recipients to access them without needing to log in. This approach combines strong security with user-friendly features. We will build The Transporter using Next.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Supabase for storage and database management, ensuring a responsive and secure platform.  

**1. Introduction**

In today's digital era, the need for secure and efficient file sharing is more critical than ever. Individuals and organizations frequently exchange sensitive information, and traditional methods often lack adequate security measures, leaving data vulnerable to unauthorized access and cyber threats.

Recognizing these challenges, we propose "The Transporter," a secure file-sharing application designed to facilitate the safe and efficient transfer of files. This application ensures that users can upload and share files with confidence, knowing that robust security protocols protect their data. By integrating automatic encryption during the upload process, The Transporter safeguards information from potential breaches.

The application streamlines the sharing process by generating unique URLs for each uploaded file. This feature allows recipients to access the shared content directly, eliminating the need for additional authentication steps while maintaining security. The combination of user-friendly design and stringent security measures ensures that file sharing is both accessible and protected.

To build this application, we have selected a modern technology stack that includes Next.js for the frontend, FastAPI for the backend, and Supabase for storage and database management. This combination offers a responsive user interface, efficient server-side processing, and secure, scalable data storage solutions.

  

**2. Problem Statement**

**4. Methodology**

The development of "The Transporter" follows a comprehensive and structured approach to ensure the creation of a secure, efficient, and user-friendly file-sharing application. This methodology encompasses several critical phases, each detailed below.

  

**a. Requirement Identification**

In this initial phase, we focus on gathering and defining the specific requirements essential for the application's success. This involves understanding user needs, technological considerations, and security imperatives.

  

**i. Study of Existing Systems**

To inform our development process, we conducted an in-depth analysis of two prominent file-sharing platforms: **Wormhole** and **WeTransfer**. This study aimed to identify strengths and weaknesses in current solutions to guide our application's design.

- **Wormhole**: Wormhole emphasizes privacy and security through end-to-end encryption. It allows users to share files up to 10 GB with links that automatically expire after 24 hours, ensuring that shared content does not remain online indefinitely. Before files leave the user's browser, they are encrypted using 128-bit AES-GCM encryption, ensuring that only the sender and intended recipients can access the content. Additionally, Wormhole employs Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) to encrypt peer-to-peer communications between browsers, providing an extra layer of protection. The platform's security configuration has been rated A+ by Mozilla Observatory, reflecting its commitment to robust web security standards.

- **WeTransfer**: WeTransfer is a widely used file-sharing platform known for its simplicity and user-friendly interface. It allows users to send files up to 2 GB for free, with larger file transfers available through its paid plans. WeTransfer encrypts files during transfer using Transport Layer Security (TLS) and at rest with AES-256 encryption. However, there have been concerns regarding the platform's security. In 2019, WeTransfer experienced a security incident where files were inadvertently sent to unintended recipients, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in its file-sharing process. Additionally, while WeTransfer offers two-factor authentication (2FA) to enhance account security, its effectiveness depends on user activation. The platform's reliance on third-party servers for file storage and transfer introduces potential risks, as unauthorized access to these servers could compromise sensitive data.

**ii.Literature Review**

The evolution of file-sharing technologies has significantly transformed data exchange methodologies, emphasizing the need for secure and efficient systems. Early file-sharing methods primarily focused on functionality, often neglecting security aspects, which led to vulnerabilities and unauthorized data access. As digital interactions expanded, the imperative for robust security measures became evident, prompting extensive research into secure file-sharing mechanisms.

Recent studies have delved into various encryption techniques to enhance file-sharing security. For instance, the implementation of hybrid encryption methods, combining symmetric and asymmetric algorithms, has been explored to bolster data protection during transmission and storage. Such approaches aim to leverage the efficiency of symmetric encryption and the security of asymmetric encryption to provide a balanced solution for secure file sharing. citeturn0search6

Moreover, the integration of blockchain technology into file-sharing systems has garnered attention for its potential to provide decentralized and tamper-proof records of data transactions.
