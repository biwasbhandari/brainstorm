### **7.2 Principles of Cryptography: Symmetric Key and Public Key**

Cryptography ensures data security through encoding (encryption) and decoding (decryption).

#### **Symmetric Key Cryptography**:

- **Definition**: The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- **Examples**: DES, AES, Blowfish.
- **Advantages**:
    - Faster and efficient for large data volumes.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Key distribution is challenging.

#### **Public Key Cryptography**:

- **Definition**: Uses a pair of keys: a public key (for encryption) and a private key (for decryption).
- **Examples**: RSA, ECC.
- **Advantages**:
    - Simplifies key distribution.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Slower than symmetric encryption.

### **7.3 Public Key Algorithm — RSA**

#### **Overview**:

RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is a widely used public-key encryption algorithm.

#### **Steps in RSA**:

1. **Key Generation**:
    
    - Select two large prime numbers (ppp and qqq).
    - Compute n=p×qn = p \times qn=p×q (modulus) and ϕ(n)=(p−1)×(q−1)\phi(n) = (p-1) \times (q-1)ϕ(n)=(p−1)×(q−1).
    - Choose an encryption key (eee) such that 1<e<ϕ(n)1 < e < \phi(n)1<e<ϕ(n) and gcd(e,ϕ(n))=1gcd(e, \phi(n)) = 1gcd(e,ϕ(n))=1.
    - Compute the decryption key (ddd) where d×emod  ϕ(n)=1d \times e \mod \phi(n) = 1d×emodϕ(n)=1.
2. **Encryption**:
    
    - Ciphertext C=Memod  nC = M^e \mod nC=Memodn, where MMM is the plaintext message.
3. **Decryption**:
    
    - Plaintext M=Cdmod  nM = C^d \mod nM=Cdmodn.

#### **Applications**:

- Secure data transmission, digital signatures, and certificate generation.

### **7.4 Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)**

#### **Definition**:

A **digital signature** is a cryptographic mechanism that verifies the authenticity and integrity of a message.

#### **How It Works**:

1. **Key Generation**:
    
    - Generates a pair of keys (private key for signing, public key for verification).
2. **Signing**:
    
    - The sender generates a hash of the message and encrypts it with their private key.
3. **Verification**:
    
    - The receiver decrypts the signature using the sender's public key and compares it to the hash of the received message.

#### **Advantages**:

- Ensures non-repudiation and data integrity.

#### **Applications**:

- Email signing, document authentication, and software distribution.
