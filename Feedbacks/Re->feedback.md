Below is the revised set of recommendations, retaining and removing sections according to your instructions, plus clarifications for AI Chat context.

1. Mobile-Focused Feedback & Layout

1.1 Active Proposals & Success Rate
	•	If the “Active Proposals,” “Success Rate,” and “Total Proposals” block is too large on mobile, compress them into compact elements (side-by-side small cards or a slim “stats bar”).
	•	Icons or minimal text can convey the data: e.g., “3 Active,” “80% Success,” “25 Total.”

1. UI/UX Best Practices from the Screenshots
	1.	One-Click “Buy”
	•	Replacing “Participate” with “Buy” on the main DAO listing is good for a single clear CTA.
	•	All advanced interactions (Vote, Propose, Chat) remain on the detailed DAO page.
	2.	DAO Details Page
	•	Encourage Stacked Sections on Mobile: Instead of tabs, stack major sections (Proposals, Analytics, AI Chat) in a vertical layout.
	•	Example Flow:
	1.	DAO Stats at the top
	2.	Proposals below
	3.	Analytics or Chart further down
	4.	AI Chat at the bottom
	•	This ensures a scrollable single-page experience on mobile.
	3.	Mobile Chat Drawer
	•	Let users expand/collapse a chat panel, or keep it as a stacked section near the bottom.
	•	The main aim is clarity and easy access without cluttering the entire page.
	4.	Responsive Layout
	•	For any data table or large chart, keep them scrollable or collapsible.
	•	Maintain big enough tap targets (≥44×44 px).

3. Communicating Multi-Agent Decision-Making
	1.	Proposal Cards
	•	Show how many agents or user tokens are voting “Yes/No,” plus a progress bar for your 66% or 90% threshold.
	2.	AI Chat: Clarity on Its Purpose
	•	In this DAO context, the “Chat with AI Agent” is where users instruct their personal AI on voting behavior, proposal preferences, or strategy.
	•	Emphasize that each agent’s vote is only one among many (with 66% or 90% needed), so the conversation is about guiding your agent’s stance rather than controlling the DAO unilaterally.
	3.	Be Specific with Additional Info
	•	If you show “Community AI Agents” stances or aggregated agent views, label it clearly: “X out of Y agents favor this proposal.”
	•	Provide a short explanation: “Multiple AI agents reflect different user instructions; 66–90% consensus is required for any action.”
	4.	(Renumbered from 3.4) Additional Guidance
	•	If you add a “Compare Votes” feature or summary, specify it plainly: e.g., “Your Agent: Supports, 10 tokens.  Other Agents: Mixed.  Overall: 45% ‘Yes.’”
	•	Keep all references to multi-agent voting straightforward—no single agent can finalize a decision alone.

4. Additional “No-Brainer” Improvements
	1.	Notifications Hooked into Discord
	•	Instead of email, let users subscribe to a Discord channel or bot for critical events (new proposals, proposals passing, major treasury actions).
	•	This fosters a real-time community vibe in a commonly used platform.
	2.	“Propose” Button
	•	On each DAO’s detail page, highlight a “+ Proposal” or “Create Proposal” button.
	•	On mobile, keep it large and near the top or bottom of the proposals stack for easy access.
	3.	Small Info Icons
	•	Next to “Voting Threshold,” “Quorum,” or “Agent Votes,” add an info icon that expands or tooltips a quick explanation (e.g., “At least 15% token quorum needed; 66% must vote yes for passage.”).
	4.	AI-Generated Summaries
	•	Optionally, let the AI generate short “recaps” or “pros & cons” for each proposal, so users skip reading long text.
	•	This can help busy participants quickly decide how to instruct their agent.

Final Takeaways
	•	For multi-agent governance, it’s crucial to remind users that no single agent decides outcomes; they all collectively form the required threshold.
	•	A stacked mobile layout keeps the DAO page intuitive: stats → proposals → analytics → chat, in a single scrollable screen.
	•	Discord notifications, big “Propose” buttons, and well-labeled info icons round out a polished, user-friendly interface.

By integrating these adjustments, you’ll deliver a cohesive, minimal-clutter mobile experience that emphasizes easy AI agent instructions, clear multi-agent voting details, and straightforward user actions.
